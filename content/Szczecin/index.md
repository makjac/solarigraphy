description: Szczecin, a city with a rich history and a unique location by the Oder River, perfectly aligns with the essence of solarigraphy – the art of capturing the passage of time through the Sun’s trails. Using this technique, one can showcase Szczecin’s iconic locations, such as Wały Chrobrego, illuminated by the changing seasons and times of day. It is a place where the harmony of nature and urban architecture creates an inspiring backdrop for the art of endurance.
