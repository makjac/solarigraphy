Solarigraphy is a unique photographic technique that captures the traces of the Sun’s movement through long-term exposures. Unlike traditional photographs, solarigraphy records a prolonged process in which an image is created by sunlight hitting a photographic material over many days, weeks, or even months. The result is stunning, otherworldly images showing the Sun’s trajectories, changing seasons, and various light effects that are impossible to capture with conventional photography.

The history of solarigraphy dates back to the 19th century, when pioneers of photography like Henry Fox Talbot experimented with long exposure techniques. In modern times, solarigraphy gained popularity among photography enthusiasts, who began using simple pinhole cameras to create images that blend art, science, and patience.

As an amateur and hobbyist, I dedicate myself to creating solarigraphic works to capture fleeting moments in a unique way. For me, it’s a hobby that allows me to discover beauty in the simplest details of daily life. Each shot is not only the result of a technical process but also a form of meditation on the passage of time. I am fascinated by how changes in nature, times of day, and seasons can shape images full of magic and mystery.

I invite you to explore this extraordinary technique on my website, where I share my works and reflections on the process of creating solarigraphy.
