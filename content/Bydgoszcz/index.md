description: Bydgoszcz, a city with a unique industrial heritage and picturesque spots along the Brda River, perfectly embodies the spirit of solarigraphy – the art of capturing the passage of time through the Sun’s movement. This technique reveals both the modern architecture and the historic corners of the city, merging its dynamic present with reflections on the perpetual motion of the world. Bydgoszcz is a place that inspires the discovery of beauty in every detail.
