description: Gniezno, the first capital of Poland, is a city rich in history and cultural significance, making it a perfect match for solarigraphy – an art form that embraces patience and keen observation of the passage of time. Capturing Gniezno through solarigraphy allows for the depiction of both the majestic towers of its cathedral and the everyday life of the city, illuminated by the unique trails of the Sun’s journey. It is a place where the past intertwines with the present, creating an ideal backdrop for the art of recording moments that span months.
