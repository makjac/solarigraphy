description: Poznań, a city full of energy and history, with its iconic market square and cathedral on Ostrów Tumski, is the perfect place to capture through solarigraphy – the art that records the passage of time through the Sun’s traces. This technique allows for capturing both the vibrant city center and the quieter, charming corners of the city, where time flows at its own pace. Poznań is a city that blends tradition with modernity, and the changing times of day and seasons create a wonderful palette of colors in photography.
