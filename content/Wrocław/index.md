description: Wrocław, a city with a unique atmosphere, full of bridges, islands, and historic buildings, is perfect for capturing through solarigraphy – an art form that records the movement of the Sun over time. This technique allows one to capture not only the city’s architecture, such as its majestic town halls and cathedrals, but also the subtle changes that occur in the urban space in harmony with nature. Wrocław is a city where every moment can become indelible, and the changing seasons create a unique landscape through the lens.
